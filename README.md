# tunts-challenge
An integral part of the Tunts selection process. The proposal consists of reading data from a spreadsheet, applying logic according to pre-established rules, and writing data based on these rules in the blank columns of the spreadsheet.

- The authentication of the google API requests was made by using the credentials.json file 
- The application was entirely made in approximately 8 hours
- Even though the proposal is simple, the application was made in a way that it can have a decent scalability
- Environment variables were used to make reading spreadsheets with different configurations possible
- An error tolerance was implemented in the reading and writing of each isolated row of the spreadsheet
- A record of execution logs has been developed and is saved on the server after each application execution
